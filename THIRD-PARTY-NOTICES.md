# Third-Party Notices

This product includes third-party software. The components below are either
vendored (a reduced copy lives in this repository under `src/tui/vendor/`) or
depended upon at their pinned versions. Provenance for the vendored subset is
recorded in the top-level [`UPSTREAM`](./UPSTREAM) file. This notices file and
`UPSTREAM` are mandated by [ADR 0018](./docs/adr/0018-adopt-opencode-presentation-as-pinned-reduced-vendor.md).

---

## OpenCode

A reduced subset of `OpenCode`'s presentation layer is vendored into
`src/tui/vendor/` (see `UPSTREAM` for the per-file inventory), copied from the
`OpenCode` project at commit `1ead9e3d7f`.

## OpenTUI (`@opentui/core`, `@opentui/keymap`, `@opentui/solid`)

OpenTUI is **not** vendored. It is a real npm dependency pinned at `0.4.5`
(unpatched, unforked). It is listed here because the vendored presentation code
renders through it.

The copyright line above is reproduced from the `LICENSE` file shipped in the
`@opentui/core@0.4.5` package (the `anomalyco/opentui` project). All three
`@opentui/*` packages are published at `0.4.5` under the MIT licence.

`@opentui/core@0.4.5` also pulls eight per-platform native packages (optional
dependencies whose Zig library is embedded in the compiled binary), of which one
is shipped per gated target (ADR 0030). The three that ship —
`@opentui/core-win32-x64`, `@opentui/core-darwin-arm64`, and
`@opentui/core-linux-x64`, all `0.4.5` under the MIT licence above — are covered
by the M4 release legal-closure gate (spec #137), which inventories the transitive
closure actually embedded per target. The five other native variants and the
historical `bun-ffi-structs@0.2.4` are not in that shipped closure (the compiler
does not admit them into the executable's module graph); they remain listed as
harmless historical entries, which the gate tolerates.

## Model Context Protocol SDK (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`)

`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` is **not** vendored. It is a real npm dependency
pinned at `1.29.0`. It is listed here because the Harness Module's MCP permission
bridge — the loopback server Claude Code's `--permission-prompt-tool` calls — is
bundled into the shipped single-file executable. It uses the existing `zod`
dependency as its schema peer.

## commander

`commander` is **not** vendored. It is a real npm dependency pinned at `14.0.2`
(zero transitive dependencies). It is listed here because the CLI's command
parsing is bundled into the shipped single-file executable.

## semver

`semver` is **not** vendored. It is a real npm dependency pinned at `7.7.4`
(the OpenCode precedent for host-version ranges). It is listed here because the
Bundle version and engine-range comparisons are bundled into the shipped
single-file executable.

## solid-js

`solid-js` is **not** vendored. It is a real npm dependency pinned at `1.9.12`
(the reactive runtime `@opentui/solid` renders through it; OpenCode carries a
different `1.9.x` from its own catalog, so this pin is Secant's, not a mirror). It
is listed here because the vendored presentation code and the shell's screens are
built as Solid components bundled into the shipped single-file executable.

## which

`which` is **not** vendored. It is a real npm dependency pinned at `6.0.1`
(the version OpenCode carries, behind its own `which` helper). It is listed here
because the executable resolver the execution Module shares with Preflight walks
PATH through it, bundled into the shipped single-file executable.

## strip-ansi

`strip-ansi` is **not** vendored. It is a real npm dependency pinned at `7.1.2`
(the version OpenCode carries, and a transitive dependency of `@opentui/core`).
It is listed here because the Run Workbench strips ANSI escape sequences from
captured command output before rendering it, bundled into the shipped single-file
executable.

## string-width

`string-width` is **not** vendored. It is a real npm dependency pinned at `7.2.0`
(a transitive dependency of `@opentui/core`, which is where the pin comes from;
OpenCode declares it in no package of its own). It is listed here because the Run
Workbench measures display columns through it when clipping rows to the terminal
width, bundled into the shipped single-file executable.

      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## Bun Runtime (`bun`)

Secant ships as a Bun single-file executable (ADR 0030), so the Bun runtime
`1.4.2` is embedded as redistributed material in every target's binary. Bun is
distributed under the MIT licence by Oven, and bundles JavaScriptCore and other
components under their own upstream terms.

## Bundled Transitive Runtime Components

The components below are pulled transitively (chiefly by `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`,
`@opentui/core`, `string-width`, and `strip-ansi`) and admitted by the compiler
into the shipped executable's module graph. The M4 release legal-closure gate
(spec #137) inventories this closure from the actual build inputs and verifies
their coverage here; their versions are the exact bytes shipped, which for a
nested duplicate can differ from a declared top-level pin.

MIT-licensed (the MIT licence text above applies):

- `@hono/node-server` `1.19.17`
- `ajv` `8.20.0`
- `ajv-formats` `3.0.1`
- `ansi-regex` `6.3.0`
- `emoji-regex` `10.6.0`
- `fast-deep-equal` `3.1.3`
- `get-east-asian-width` `1.6.0`
- `json-schema-traverse` `1.0.0`

ISC-licensed (the ISC licence text above applies):

- `isexe` `2.0.0`
- `which` `2.0.2` (a nested transitive copy, distinct from the declared `which` `6.0.1` above)
- `zod-to-json-schema` `3.25.2`
